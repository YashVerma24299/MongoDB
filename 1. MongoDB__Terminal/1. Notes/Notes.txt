MONGOSH or Mongodb Shell:
    It is a command-line tool used to interact with MongoDB.
    Mongosh fully supports CRUD operations.
    Works with BSON (Binary JSON), which extends JSON with additional data types.


BSON (Binary JSON, used in MongoDB):
    Supports additional types like ObjectId, Date, Binary Data, Decimal128, Timestamp, etc.
    In MongoDB, data is stored in BSON format even if we write it in JSON format.


All run in Terminal:
    RUN -> Mongosh
    Try:
        1+2
        "yash".toUpperCase();
        show dbs;
        db


Document: Mongo store data in form of document (BSON docs)
Collection: Mongo stores document in Collection.

IN GENERAL:
    Database ->    tables   ->  row     // Relational Database
    Database -> Collections -> document // MongoDB
